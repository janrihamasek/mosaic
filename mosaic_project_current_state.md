# Mosaic Project – Current State Report

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose and Goals
Mosaic is a full-stack activity tracking platform that helps individuals log daily rituals, measure streaks, and analyze progress toward personal goals. Users capture activities with qualitative notes, review day-level summaries, and monitor long-term performance. The platform emphasises low-friction data entry, rich validation, and near-real-time feedback through aggregated statistics.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 with modern hooks, React Router v6, Redux Toolkit for state management, Axios for HTTP, react-hook-form for form orchestration, and a custom dark-mode design system defined in `styles/common.js`.
- **Backend:** Flask 3 application organised in `app.py`, supported by Flask-CORS, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, PyJWT for authentication, and Pydantic for request validation.
- **Database:** SQLite (`database/mosaic.db`) accessed via SQLAlchemy models. The project includes schema bootstrap scripts (`database/schema.sql`, `init_db.py`) and indices tuned for reporting queries.
- **Tooling & Infrastructure:** Jest is not yet configured, but backend tests run via Pytest with coverage reporting. GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) run backend unit tests, provide coverage artifacts, and build the frontend bundle. The frontend build relies on Create React App, with TypeScript configured in `allowJs` mode and `noEmit` to keep the workspace lint-only.

### Development History and Direction
Recent development (see `docs/changelog/2025-10-29_backend_frontend_summary.md`) delivered:
- A Pydantic-backed validation layer replacing ad-hoc JSON checks.
- Transactional guards for all mutating endpoints with consistent error envelopes.
- Full JWT + CSRF authentication, frontend token storage, and CSRF-aware Axios interceptors.
- Unified dashboard statistics pipeline (`/stats/progress`) consolidating 30-day metrics with cache-aware invalidation.
- React forms migrated to react-hook-form for richer validation.
- New reusable loading and error states plus centralized toast notifications.

The current trajectory focuses on resilience, consistency across form UX, cache-aware analytics, and preparing for broader integrations (CSV import pipelines, future wearable device hooks).

```

### Layer Interactions
- **React ⇄ Flask:** The frontend uses `apiClient.js` (Axios) to call Flask endpoints. The request interceptor injects `Authorization` and CSRF headers via `authService`. Responses feed Redux thunks; errors funnel through a global event (`mosaic-api-error`) consumed by the dashboard to display toasts.
- **Redux as integration layer:** Redux thunks (e.g., `loadEntries`, `createActivity`) coordinate async calls and trigger secondary effects such as cache invalidations (by refetch). Components subscribe via selectors to minimise re-rendering.
- **Persistent state:** Auth tokens and expiry metadata live in localStorage through `authService`. Redux initialises slices by hydrating persistent auth and filter preferences (e.g., `entries.filters`).
- **Database access:** Flask routes use SQLAlchemy for migrations-plus-ORM access and raw `sqlite3` for bulk reads with manual caching. Transactions are handled by `db_transaction()` context managers to ensure atomicity.

### Redux Store Structure
- **`authSlice`**: Tracks authentication status, tokens, and async lifecycle states (`login`, `register`, `logout`). Thunks wrap `authService` calls and propagate friendly error messages.
- **`activitiesSlice`**: Maintains active/all activity lists, mutation status, and selectors for detail modals. Thunks wrap `fetchActivities`, `addActivity`, etc., and coordinate refreshes of related slices (`loadToday`, `loadEntries`).
- **`entriesSlice`**: Holds paginated entry lists, filters, `/today` data (rows, dirty cache, auto-save state), the stats dashboard snapshot (single payload + anchor date), and import status. Thunks orchestrate entries, stats, and today pipelines, ensuring caches stay in sync.
- Store composition occurs in `store/index.js` which configures Redux Toolkit with serialisation-aware middleware (defaults) and exports typed hooks.

### Primary Data Flows
1. **User Authentication:** `LoginForm` validates credentials client-side, dispatches `auth/login`, receives JWT + CSRF, persists tokens, and updates headers. Private routes in `App.jsx` guard dashboard access.
2. **Daily Tracking:** `Today.jsx` fetches `/today` via `loadToday`, renders entries, and schedules auto-saves through `saveDirtyTodayRows` (posting to `/add_entry`). Mutations invalidate caches in Flask, prompting Redux to refresh.
3. **Activity Management:** `ActivityForm` collects metadata, dispatches `createActivity` (`POST /add_activity`), and reloads activities/entries/today slices. `ActivityTable` toggles activation/deletion via RESTful endpoints.
4. **Statistics:** `Stats.jsx` dispatches `loadStats` to `/stats/progress`, receiving a unified snapshot (goal completion, streak, distribution, fulfilment, polarity, consistency) that powers the refreshed dashboard widgets.
5. **CSV Import:** `CsvImportButton` validates files client-side, dispatches `importEntries`, and shows toast results summarising create/update/skip counts.

## 3. Data Model and API

### Database Schema
- **`activities`**: `id`, `name`, `category`, `goal`, `description`, `active`, `frequency_per_day`, `frequency_per_week`, `deactivated_at`. Indices on `category`.
- **`entries`**: `id`, `date`, `activity`, `description`, `value`, `note`, denormalised `activity_category` and `activity_goal` plus a unique `(date, activity)` constraint. Indices across `date`, `activity`, and `activity_category`.
- **`users`**: `id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `created_at`.

Schema management: `ensure_schema` in `app.py` inspects `PRAGMA table_info` to add missing columns and migrates data for new fields. Flask-Migrate is initialised for future migrations.

### API Surface
- **Authentication:** `POST /register`, `POST /login` yield JWT + CSRF tokens. Tokens include per-session CSRF embedded in payload; CSRF enforcement occurs on all unsafe methods.
- **Entries:** `GET /entries` (paginated & filterable), `POST /add_entry` (upsert by `(date, activity)`), `DELETE /entries/<id>`. `POST /finalize_day` marks a day as locked and clears caches.
- **Activities:** `GET /activities` (with `?all=true` handles archived items), `POST /add_activity`, `PUT /activities/<id>`, `PATCH /activities/<id>/activate|deactivate`, `DELETE /activities/<id>`.
- **Analytics:** `GET /today` returns denormalised daily rows, `GET /stats/progress` delivers the 30-day dashboard snapshot (goal completion, streaks, distribution, fulfilment), `/import_csv` handles bulk ingestion.
- **Infrastructure:** `GET /healthz` (if present) & root route verifying DB path.

### Validation, Auth, and Rate Limiting
- **Validation:** `security.py` routes JSON to Pydantic schemas (`ActivityCreatePayload`, `EntryPayload`, etc.), normalises values (trimmed strings, numeric conversions), and attaches computed properties (`goal`).
- **Auth:** JWT signed with `MOSAIC_JWT_SECRET`, expiration controlled by `MOSAIC_JWT_EXP_MINUTES`. Tokens validated per request; expired tokens trigger refresh workflows in frontend and backend.
- **Rate Limiting:** Memory-based limiter keyed by route and user/IP, configured via `app.config["RATE_LIMITS"]`. Responses provide `too_many_requests`.
- **CSRF:** Each token issues a `csrf_token`; Flask checks request headers for `X-CSRF-Token` matching payload.

### Caching and Invalidation
- `_cache_storage` in `app.py` stores TTL-bound results keyed by prefix (e.g., `"today::2025-10-29::100::0"`). `/today` cache TTL = 60 seconds; `/stats` TTL = 300 seconds. Mutations call `invalidate_cache("today")` or `invalidate_cache("stats")` to ensure coherency post-write.

## 4. Frontend (React)

### Component Landscape
- **`App.jsx`**: Routes login/register vs. authenticated dashboard; listens for global API error events to trigger toasts.
- **`Dashboard` (within `App.jsx`)**: Controls tabbed navigation (`Today`, `Activities`, `Stats`, `Entries`), orchestrates data bootstrapping, and hosts `Notification` toasts, `LogoutButton`, and detail modals.
- **Input Forms**: `LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `ActivityForm`, `EntryForm` all migrate to react-hook-form with inline validation, accessibility attributes, and disabled submit states until valid.
- **Visualisation Components**: `Today` handles daily entry grids with autosave; `Stats` now renders a dashboard of meters, charts, and consistency bars fed by the unified snapshot; `ActivityTable`/`EntryTable` present sortable lists augmented with new `Loading` and `ErrorState` wrappers.
- **Utility Components**: `CsvImportButton` (file picker with validation), `Notification` (toast styling), `Loading` (spinner with fade-in), `ErrorState` (retry banner).

### State and Validation Patterns
- Redux thunks orchestrate server calls and cache invalidations. React-hook-form enforces client-side trimming, regex validation (email), numeric ranges, and cross-field checks (confirm password, date ranges).
- The dark theme is consistent: `styles/common.js` centralises card, input, and button styling. `Loading`/`ErrorState` reuse animation keyframes injected once via `utils/animations.js`.
- Navigation persists active tab in `localStorage` to provide continuity across reloads.

### Daily Summaries & Activities
- `Today` fetches the user’s focus day, calculates progress ratios, and animates bar charts. Auto-save triggers `saveDirtyTodayRows` after debounce, giving user feedback (`Changes auto-saved`).
- `ActivityForm` computes average daily goal server-side but also derives preview `avgGoalPerDay` for UI display. `ActivityTable` handles activation toggles and detail viewing (tied into `ActivityDetail`).
- `Stats` surfaces the snapshot metrics (today’s completion, streak badge, pie distribution, 7/30-day trend line, polarity split, consistency bars) with shared `Loading`/`ErrorState` states and a refresh action.

## 5. Testing and Quality

### Backend Test Coverage
- **`test_auth.py`**: Registration/login lifecycle, invalid credentials, expired tokens, cache helper behaviour.
- **`test_api.py`**: End-to-end activity CRUD, entry creation/deletion, pagination, CSV import scenarios, finalise-day flows, rate limits.
- **`test_validation.py`**: Verifies Pydantic schema enforcement (frequency ranges, required fields, CSV presence).
- **`test_transactions.py`**: Ensures transaction rollback semantics and atomic operations when errors occur mid-batch.
- Tests run under Pytest with coverage (`pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml`) in CI.

### Frontend Quality Practices
- Frontend currently relies on manual testing and the CRA build as a smoke check (`npm run build --if-present`). React component tests are not yet introduced; however, form validation is deterministic via react-hook-form.
- Manual test plans accompany recent features (e.g., react-hook-form integration, loading/error states) outlining behaviour to confirm before release.

### Continuous Integration
- **`tests.yml`**: Dual job workflow running backend pytest and frontend build on pushes/PRs to `main`.
- **`backend-tests.yml`**: Narrow workflow re-running backend tests when backend files change, capturing coverage reports.
- CI ensures dependencies install cleanly on Python 3.11/3.12 and Node 18, acting as regression safety net.

## 6. Current Development Status

### Latest Enhancements
- **Form UX Modernisation:** All primary forms now use react-hook-form with inline messages, accessible aria attributes, and disabled submit buttons until valid.
- **Unified Loading/Error Handling:** New `Loading` and `ErrorState` components provide animated feedback and retry affordances, adopted across `/today`, `/entries`, and `/activities`.
- **Global Error Notifications:** Axios response interceptor emits `mosaic-api-error`; `Dashboard` listens and surfaces toasts, consolidating error UX.
- **CSV Import Hardening:** Client-side validation prevents accidental uploads (extension/size checks) before dispatching `importEntries`.
- **Caching & Invalidation:** Backend caches (`today`, `stats`) tied to state invalidation, improving responsiveness while avoiding stale reads.

### Open Work and TODOs
- **Frontend Automated Tests:** No unit/integration tests yet; high-value targets include form validation, Redux thunks, and component rendering.
- **Stats Snapshot Testing:** The refreshed `Stats.jsx` surface lacks automated tests (visual or snapshot) to guard the new charts and ratios.
- **Type Safety:** The project is JavaScript-only; adopting TypeScript or PropTypes would reduce regressions.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Current layout is desktop centric; responsive breakpoints and mobile gestures remain unimplemented.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Present stats focus on goal ratios; product roadmap mentions richer analytics and wearable integrations but no code yet.

### Planned/Proposed Directions
- Stabilise API contracts and add migration tooling before scaling beyond SQLite (e.g., to PostgreSQL).
- Extend CI to include frontend lint/test suites and deploy previews.
- Implement server-side pagination for tables within UI (currently limited to backend defaults).
- Explore WebSocket or SSE for live-tracking scenarios once multi-device sync becomes necessary.

## 7. Summary and Recommendations

### Strengths
- **Robust Validation & Security:** Pydantic schemas, JWT + CSRF, structured error envelopes, and rate limiting provide a safe API surface.
- **Consistent UX:** React-hook-form, shared styling, and global notifications ensure uniform behaviour across forms and tables.
- **Caching & Performance:** TTL caches on heavy read endpoints plus targeted invalidation deliver quick responses without stale data risks.
- **Automated Testing & CI:** Backend tests cover core flows with coverage reporting; GitHub Actions ensure regressions are caught early.

### Weaknesses
- **Limited Frontend Test Coverage:** Reliance on manual testing increases regression risk, especially with the growing component surface.
- **SQLite Concurrency Constraints:** The single-file database works for prototypes but will bottleneck under higher concurrency without migration planning.
- **Analytics Accessibility Gaps:** The new stats widgets lack dedicated accessible descriptions and keyboard interactions for charts, leaving screen-reader support incomplete.
- **Documentation Duplication:** API docs live in Markdown, but there is no generated schema or OpenAPI spec to keep backend and frontend fully synchronised.

### Recommendations
1. **Testing Investment:** Introduce Jest + React Testing Library to cover form validation, global error handling, and Redux thunks. Pair with Cypress (or Playwright) smoke tests for mission-critical flows.
2. **Database Evolution:** Prepare a migration plan (Flask-Migrate scripts, staging environment) for moving to PostgreSQL as data volume grows. Define archival strategies for `entries`.
3. **Analytics Expansion:** Layer accessibility metadata onto the new widgets, explore predictive/compare-to-target metrics, and consider chart libraries for maintainable rendering and tooltips.
4. **Mobile & Accessibility Enhancements:** Introduce responsive breakpoints, keyboard shortcuts, and screen reader audits to broaden usability.
5. **DevEx Improvements:** Add linting (ESLint, Prettier) and TypeScript migration roadmap to improve developer ergonomics and catch issues earlier.
6. **Integration Roadmap:** Design interfaces for wearable or external data ingestion, potentially via scheduled imports plus extended CSV schema support.
