# 2025-10-29 Backend and Frontend Summary

## 1. Input Validation (Pydantic)
Manual input checks were replaced with a Pydantic-based validation layer connected to all Flask endpoints. The new helpers in `security.py` standardize error responses and enforce operation-specific guards. Schemas in `schemas.py` cover all payload types — entries, activities, CSV imports, and finalize-day requests — with custom validators for formats, ranges, and goal logic. Tests verify both valid and invalid paths, and the documentation now details the validation approach. Pydantic was added to `requirements.txt`.

## 2. SQLite Transactions
The backend now uses a unified SQLite transaction context ensuring atomic writes — each route either fully commits or rolls back. The CSV importer is wrapped in the same guard, leaving the database unchanged after failed imports. SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate scaffolding were introduced with CLI tools for migrations. Tests include a rollback simulation, and documentation explains the new migration workflow.

## 3. Standardized Error Responses
All backend errors now follow a consistent structured format containing `code`, `message`, and `details`. A shared `error_response` helper in `security.py` enriches `ValidationError` objects, and Flask’s global middleware unifies all exception handling. Previous ad‑hoc `jsonify({"error": ...})` branches were removed. Tests verify all error types, and documentation reflects the standardized error envelope.

## 4. JWT Authentication and Security Layer
The backend now provides full JWT authentication and CSRF protection. New `/register` and `/login` endpoints issue bearer and CSRF tokens. Middleware enforces access to protected routes, and validation/rate limiting now use user-scoped rules. The database gained a `users` table and token signing via PyJWT. Tests verify authentication, token validity, and rate limiting. Documentation describes the login flow, required headers, and limits.

## 5. Frontend Authentication Integration
The frontend now supports registration, login, and logout according to the new API contract. Added `authService` for token management and error handling, an Axios `apiClient` with interceptors, and React components (`LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `LogoutButton`). The app is wrapped in `AuthProvider` and `PrivateRoute`, securing the dashboard. Tokens persist in localStorage; expired sessions trigger a redirect and message. UI errors use clear Czech messages. Documentation and tests were updated accordingly.

## 6. Query Optimization and Pagination
Pagination via `limit` and `offset` was added to `/entries`, `/activities`, `/stats/progress`, and `/today` (default 100/0, max 500). Indexes were added to `entries(date)`, `entries(activity)`, `entries(activity_category)`, and `activities(category)` for faster queries. Documentation lists pagination parameters and indexing rationale. Tests confirm proper pagination and error handling.

## 7. Caching for Frequent Endpoints
A lightweight in‑process TTL cache was introduced for hot read endpoints. `app.py` includes `cache_get`, `cache_set`, and `invalidate_cache` helpers with thread‑safe storage. `/today` caches by (date, limit, offset) for ~60 s, and `/stats/progress` for ~5 min using full query parameters. All mutating routes (add/delete entries, activity CRUD, finalize day, CSV import) automatically invalidate cache prefixes. Tests verify cache invalidation; documentation covers TTLs and cache behavior. No new dependencies were added.

## 8. Unit Tests and CI Automation
Comprehensive tests now cover authentication and caching. They validate register/login flows, invalid credentials, expired tokens, and cache behavior with simulated time. A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) was added to install dependencies, run pytest, and build the React app automatically on every push or pull request. The README notes automatic CI execution.

## 9. Cleanup and Dependency Check
The backend’s caching utilities were unified, ensuring all write paths touching entries or activities clear `/today` and `/stats` caches. Tests for auth and cache were consolidated and fixed for stable timing. All required Python dependencies (Flask, Flask‑CORS, Flask‑Migrate, Flask‑SQLAlchemy, PyJWT, Pydantic, pytest) and frontend dependencies (`axios`, `react‑router‑dom`) are already present and verified — no redundant or missing packages.

### Overall Status
The backend and frontend are now functionally complete: secure, validated, transactional, cache‑aware, and continuously tested. The system meets stability and integration goals, and remaining work focuses on analytical modules, performance tuning, and extended test coverage.
