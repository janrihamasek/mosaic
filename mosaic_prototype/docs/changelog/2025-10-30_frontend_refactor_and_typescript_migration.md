# 2025-10-30 Frontend Refactor and TypeScript Migration

## 1. State Management Migration
Local state and the legacy AuthContext were replaced with a unified Redux Toolkit architecture.  
Central slices now manage authentication, entries, and activities, ensuring that all UI components react consistently to global state updates.

- Introduced `src/store/index.js` configuring Redux Toolkit with persistent auth hydration.  
- Added slices: `authSlice`, `entriesSlice`, `activitiesSlice` with async thunks and cache-refresh side effects.  
- Updated all forms, tables, and dashboard components (`Today`, `Stats`, `ActivityForm`, `EntryForm`, etc.) to use selectors and dispatchers instead of local state.  
- CSV import flow now triggers automatic `/today` and `/stats` invalidation through Redux.  
- Added dependencies `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`; removed obsolete `AuthContext`.

Result: global and predictable state updates, reduced duplication, and better compatibility with testing tools.

## 2. Form Validation (react-hook-form Integration)
All user-facing forms were migrated to `react-hook-form` for standardized validation, accessibility, and input control.

- Applied to `LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, `ActivityForm`, and `EntryForm`, enforcing required fields, length limits, numeric ranges, and confirmation checks.  
- Inline error messages and red border styles unify feedback across all forms.  
- Submit buttons now disable automatically until valid and idle.  
- CSV import gained lightweight client-side validation for file type and size before dispatching to `/import_csv`.  

Result: consistent and secure client-side validation aligned with backend Pydantic schemas.

## 3. Unified Loading and Error Handling
Introduced reusable components for consistent asynchronous feedback.

- Added `Loading.jsx` and `ErrorState.jsx` with shared keyframe animations (`utils/animations.js`).  
- Integrated across `Today`, `Entries`, `Activities`, and `Stats` screens.  
- Connected Axios interceptor to emit a global `mosaic-api-error` event handled by the Dashboard toast system for uniform error notifications.

Result: centralized loading and error UX across all API-driven views.

---

## 4. Responsive Design System
Implemented the foundation of a unified responsive layout for mobile and tablet use.

- Added `rem`-based viewport constants, breakpoint tokens, and reusable media query helpers in `styles/common.js`.  
- Introduced `useBreakpoints.js` with `useCompactLayout` hook for responsive rendering logic.  
- Refactored major screens (`Dashboard`, `Today`, `Stats`, `ActivityTable`, `EntryTable`, `Notification`) to adapt layout, spacing, and controls based on device width.  

Result: seamless responsive behavior and improved readability on handheld devices.

---

## 5. Shared UI Components
Extracted repetitive UI patterns into reusable building blocks.

- **`FormWrapper.jsx`** – standardized form container with responsive layout and shared submit/cancel actions.  
- **`DataTable.jsx`** – generic table component with built-in loading/error/empty states and automatic stacking for compact screens.  
- **`ModalForm.jsx`** – dark-mode modal wrapper with backdrop handling, scroll lock, and configurable dismissal rules.  
- Existing forms and tables refactored to consume these shared components, minimizing layout duplication.

Result: cleaner component structure, unified dark-theme presentation, and simplified maintenance.

---

## 6. TypeScript Migration (Phase 1)
Initiated an incremental migration to TypeScript to enhance robustness and developer ergonomics.

- Added `tsconfig.json` with `allowJs=true` and `strict=false` for hybrid compatibility.  
- Converted foundational components (`Loading`, `ErrorState`, `ModalForm`) to `.tsx` with explicit prop interfaces.  
- Created shared type declarations (`src/types/api.d.ts`, `src/types/props.d.ts`) defining `Activity`, `Entry`, and `ApiError` interfaces.  
- Verified that both `npm start` and `npm run build` complete successfully.  

Result: TypeScript environment validated; the base for full type-safe migration is now in place.

### Overall Status
The frontend underwent a major structural upgrade:  
Redux Toolkit centralized state handling, all forms now use standardized validation, responsive design is unified, UI logic was consolidated into shared components, and the groundwork for TypeScript migration was laid.  
The application remains functionally stable while gaining long-term maintainability and scalability improvements.
